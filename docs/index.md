# Mystic Wiki
A metaphysically sound magic system wiki for creative fantasy works.

## Overview

The goal is to create a flexible, extensible magic and world-building system
that can be used as an integrated soft or hard magic system. The system should
have mechanics and explanations for:

- What are souls?
- How and why do gods interact with the world?
- How can different worlds have different rules?
- How can one transmigrate or reincarnate from one world to another?
- How might a LitRPG "System" work in a world?

While the focus is on the systems themselves and not specific worlds, collaborations are open for additions to specific worlds created within this system.
